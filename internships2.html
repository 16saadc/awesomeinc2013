		<h1 class="story">Who We Are</h1>
		<p class="story">
		Team Alpha is a group of interns, but don't let them hear you call them that. Besides working at the most exciting place in town, Team Alpha members have opportunities, resources, and mentorships to pursue their passions. For example, Huu Nguyen, aka Ninja, not only does web development for Awesome Inc websites, he also runs a business called ZenBanana that does web development.

	<div class="why">
		<h1 class="why">Why We're Awesome</h1>
		<p class="why">
		Team Alpha currently has around twenty members. Team Alpha's leader, Garrett, is way more fun than any other boss you'll have. Our video team gets to hang out with millionaires, like the Dippin' Dots inventor and the founder of Papa John's, for their work on the Founders Series. And our programming team gets to work on sweet mobile apps and learn to code cool websites, such as 5Across.org, AwesomeIncU.com, and our main site--AwesomeInc.org.

	<div class="what" style="text-align:right">
		<h1 class="what">What We Need</h1>
		<p class="what">
		We're looking for anyone who wants to have fun and follow Rule #4: "Always do something awesome over something not awesome. Our primary needs are for people interested in video, web development, and graphic design. We also need event coordinators, social media whizzes, marketing and PR people, and writers for our blogs.

		<h1 class="join">Why You Should Join</h1>
		<p class="join">
		While you won't get paid with money, you will get free Double Stuf Oreos, a free T-shirt, and awesome opportunities you won't get at other jobs. Also, if you're good enough, you can get a sweet nickname like Party, Cool, Thunder, Focus, and Green T did.
