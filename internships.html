		<p class="story">
		Team Alpha currently has around twenty members. Team Alpha's leader, Garrett, is way more fun than any other boss you'll have. Our video team gets to hang out with millionaires, like the Dippin' Dots inventor and the founder of Papa John's, for their work on the Founders Series. And our programming team gets to work on sweet mobile apps and learn to code cool websites, such as 5Across.org, AwesomeIncU.com, and our main site--AwesomeInc.org.

Our primary needs are for people interested in video, web development, and graphic design. We also need event coordinators, social media whizzes, marketing and PR people, and writers for our blogs.
